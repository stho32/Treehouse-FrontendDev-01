        <h2>Continuous (re)education</h2>
        <p>Well there is this thing about learning. It just goes on and on.
          Here is where I stand. Round-and-about.

        <h2>A few stuffs on my experience.</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I've worked professionally since 2004, after having earned a B.Sc. in Business Informatics.</li>
          <li>It took me some time to figure out how to set up my continuous life long learning. Most learning has been performed on the job and after the job. Reading books and blogs and watching videos.</li>
          <li>I should have about 29920 hours of coding under my belt. But it is just a guess based on average working hours.</li>
          <li>I have earned a few Microsoft Certs since then. But only a few. I want to do more of that.</li>
          <li><a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/stho">Pluralsight</a> has a nice little profile of me. Don't believe what they say about T-SQL. I have done awesome stuff there. Somehow their test doesn't like me. But the rest looks about accurate.</li>
          <li><a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/stefanhoffmann">Team Treehouse</a> has something about me, too. But you can only see, that I spent time there, not if I'm any good at it.</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/stho32">github</a> has some repositories of me. Which are still only a faint look at the things I do for living.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>... but whatever.</p>
